# Deep Learning Projects with PyTorch [Video]
This is the code repository for [Deep Learning Projects with PyTorch [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/deep-learning-projects-pytorch-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788997591), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
PyTorch is a Deep Learning framework that is a boon for researchers and data scientists. It supports Graphic Processing Units and is a platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed. With PyTorch, you can dynamically build neural networks and easily perform advanced Artificial Intelligence tasks.
The course starts with the fundamentals of PyTorch and how to use basic commands. Next, you’ll learn about Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) throughan example of image recognition, where you’ll look into images from a machine perspective. 
The next project shows you how to predict share prices using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Long Short Term Memory Network (LSTM). Then you’ll learn to work with Self Organizing Maps to detect credit card fraud. After that, it’s time to develop a system using Boltzmann Machines, where you’ll recommend whether to watch a movie or not.
We’ll continue withBoltzmann Machines, where you’ll learn to give movie ratings using AutoEncoders. At the end, you’ll get to develop and train a model to recognize a picture or an object from agiven image using Deep Learning, where we’ll not only detect the shape, but also the color of the object.
By the end of the course, you’ll be able to start using PyTorch to build Deep Learning models by implementing practical projects in the real world. So, grab this course as it will take you through interesting real-world projects to train your first neural nets.
